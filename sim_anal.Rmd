Once all explanatory and covariate data is aggregated to the response data observations, it can be used to train models of crop production (yield) or quality (protein). Experimentally varying input rates (fertilizer or seed) is crucial to developing the function for the relationship between the crop response and input. These models are then used in a Monte Carlo simulation that randomly selects an economic condition (winter wheat price, price of fertilizer or seed) to generate the probability of outcomes. Because the farmer has to make a decision on their input rates by March 30th for winter wheat, the farmer will not know the weather conditions for the rest of the growing season, so the user will be able to select a year or scenario to simulate. 

#### Execute Simulation/Analysis
The activity workflow for simulating management outcomes is described below in Figures 1 and 2. Analysis and simulation require the user to select the field of interest and variables to optimize on (yield and/or protein) and other data specifications, farm specific parameters such as fixed costs and farmer selected input rates, and parameters related to the simulation, such as whether to vary prices, weather, or both. The user also has control over the model functional type used and how to optimize the input. The simulation is a Monte-Carlo simulation that iteratively selects a year from a period of record from which to predict crop responses and net-returns under that year's observed price and or weather conditions. After the simulation, the probability of the site-specific optimization management strategy can be compared to other strategies such as the minimum rate of input (typically zero for nitrogen fertilzier, non-zero for seeding rates), the farmer selected uniform rate, the full-field optimized rate, and the actual experiment applied. The user can use this tool to simulate different management outcomes under various economic and climate scenarios to decide conditions for which to make an input prescription for the upcoming year.
