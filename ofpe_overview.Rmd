title: "OFPE Overview"
---
The vignettes of the OFPE package follow the OFPE framework workflow. This process consists of creating a database with user specified field and farm data, importing data collected on-fields and from open sources, enriching yield and protein datasets, analyzing response of yield and protein to variable input rates, predicting net-return outcomes of management strategies, and generating site-specific prescriptions of inputs.

The process follows the OFPE framework below where on-farm and open source data are combined to generate a low cost decsion aid for dryland winter wheat producers. The virtuous cycle of experimentation and data collection makes predictions stronger year after year. See [Lawrence et al. 2015](http://weedeco.msu.montana.edu/publications/pdfs/Lawrence_etal_2015.pdf) for an anaysis of the time it takes for OFPE to pay off.

#### OFPE Data Schema
Below are schematics of the general On-Field Precision Experiments data workflow and a more detailed diagrma.

![Key is found in the top right corner of the schematic. The green ring represents the R-Shiny OFPE web spplication which is driven by the OFPE R-Package (blue ring). These both require connection to a PostgreSQL spatial database with PostGIS enabled. The yellow boxes represent different pages of the OFPE web application and vignettes in the R-package. Black boxes represent user inputs and orange clouds represent cloud based tools. ](diagrams/ofpe_data_workflow.png)

![Key is found in the top left corner of the schematic. Green arrows represent processes that require the OFPE package. The PostgreSQL database in the center of the figure can be stored on a cloud server or a local computer (as indicated by shape). Dark blue boxes indicate processes that are vignettes of the OFPE package or pages of the OFPE Web Application. Light blue boxes represent alternate modules for executable processes.](diagrams/ofpe_data_diagram.png)
