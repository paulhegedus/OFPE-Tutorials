title: "Prescription Generation"
---
After the user analyzes the field specific data from their specified year and decides on a management strategy, a prescriptive fertilizer or seed map can be generated based on optimizing inputs. This optimization can take the form of profit maximization or profit maximization and pollution minimization. This prescription can reflect a specified price scenario or the *mean/median* of inputs across simulation results. The prescription is exported as a shapefile that the farmer can upload to their equipment and apply the inputs.

#### Rx Creation
The activity workflow for generating prescriptions is described below in Figure 1 and 2. This workflow follows the same steps as the analysis and simulation process, albeit with some extra input parameters such as equipment and treatment specifications and, optionally, specified experimental rates. If it is not the first year making an experiment, the simualtion is performed under the specified conditions and used to generate optimized rates under the uncertainty surrounding the conditions selected. The optimum rates are used as the background rate and experimental rates are randomly stratified across the field. The resulting prescription is then downloaded to the user as an ESRI shapefile.

Blue activities are chained together by arrows, and black boxes indicate the addition of user inputs. Diamonds represent logical statements, where FALSE returns are routed from the side of the diamond and TRUE returns are routed from the top or bottom of the diamond.](diagrams/ofpe_rx_gen_pt1.png)
