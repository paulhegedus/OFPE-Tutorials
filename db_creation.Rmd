title: "Database Creation"
---
The OFPE process begins with the creation of a spatial database for storing data gathered from farms and from satellite sources. This database is set up in  a specific OFPE format to support the ensuing workflow and requires the user to specify the boundaries of fields selected for data intensive management and the farm boundary within which a farmer's fields fall. This is a one-time process where once the database is set up it will only need management to keep it up to date.

The user will need access to an OFPE formatted database or need to create their own. In order to do this, see this [tutorial](postgres_setup.html) for downloading PostgreSQL and setting up a local postgres server. If using a preexisting database, the user will need the host, username, password, and database driver.

#### Database Schematic
The database schematic is outlined below;

#### Build/Update Database
The user will need access to or need to create necessary farm and field boundaries associated with their experimental fields to set up their database. These farm boundaries that encompass the fields within a farmer's ownership/management purview are imported as assets into Google Earth Engine and imported into the database. See this [tutorial](create_shp_qgis.html) for creating a shapefile of a field or farm boundary. These are necessary for identifying data based on geographic location rather than searching files for information keying in on field or farm specific information. Farm boundaries are also used as the bounding boxes for downloading Google Earth Engine data.

The process for creating a database is outlined in the activity diagram below. The user needs some field and farm boundaries to create the database, however field and farm boundaries can be added or modified later by connecting to the database and runnning the 'Add X' modules.

And a diagram of the components for executing the database creation and management workflow are outlined below;
