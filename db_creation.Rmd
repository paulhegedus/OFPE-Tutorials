title: "Database Creation"
---
The OFPE process begins with the creation of a spatial database for storing data gathered from farms and from satellite sources. This database is set up in  a specific OFPE format to support the ensuing workflow and requires the user to specify the boundaries of fields selected for data intensive management and the farm boundary within which a farmer's fields fall. This is a one-time process where once the database is set up it will only need management to keep it up to date.

#### Database Schematic
The database schematic is outlined below;

![TODO: Update figure. OFPE database schematic. Legend is in top left. Blue boxes represent schemas within the database. Orange boxes represent tables within schemas, and grey boxes are columns within each table.](diagrams/ofpe_db_schema.png)

#### Build Database

The user will need access to or need to create necessary farm and field boundaries associated with their experimental fields to set up their database. These farm boundaries that encompass the fields within a farmer's ownership/management purview are imported as assets into Google Earth Engine and imported into the database. See this [tutorial](<postgres_setup.html>) for creating a shapefile of a field and farm boundary.

The process for creating a database is outlined in the activity diagram below;

And a diagram of the components for executing the database creation and management workflow are outlined below;
